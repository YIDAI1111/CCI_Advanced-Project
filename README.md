**Style Transfer Interface Design**

**Brief**: This project aims to provide a web application for different kinds of users interested in style transfer to explore different art styles without requiring any technical or programming background. The interaction works off a playful tension between what defines explainable AI and creative tools for art. The conceptual design originated from image style transfer using TensorFlow, as taught by Rebecca Fiebrink.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66401375/142431755-c2746ec4-23c7-424f-bfc6-b34407fa31b2.png)
