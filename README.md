**Style Transfer Interface Design**

**Brief**: This project aims to provide a web application for different kinds of users interested in style transfer to explore different art styles without requiring any technical or programming background. The interaction works off a playful tension between what defines explainable AI and creative tools for art. The conceptual design originated from image style transfer using TensorFlow, as taught by Rebecca Fiebrink.
